.Sh NAME
.Nm priv
.Nd execute commands as a different user
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm priv
.Ar command Op Ar "arguments"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Priv
allows authorised users to execute commands that run as different
users.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is invoked, it reads a list of authorised commands from a database
file called
.Pa /usr/local/etc/priv/\fRusername\fP .
Each line of the database file is a colon-seperated list of fields.
The first two fields must be specified.
Blank lines or lines beginning with a ``#'' character are ignored.
The fields, in order, are:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent -compact
expiry date
user name to run command as
flags
command name
.Ed
.Pp
The format of the expiry date is YYYYMMDDhhmm.
.Pp
The flags field is an integer that contains the following bits:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent -compact
#define F_SETUID   00001   /* allow set-{g,u}id programs to run */
#define F_SYMLINK  00002   /* allow symlink as command run */
#define F_BASENAME 00002   /* only check basename of command */
#define F_LOGLS    00010   /* do an 'ls' of the command run */
#define F_LOGCWD   00020   /* log working directory */
#define F_LOGCMD   00040   /* log full command name */
#define F_LOGTTY   00100   /* log user's terminal */
#define F_SU       0100000 /* check su to an account */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Em F_SU
flags enables
.Nm
to authorise an
.Xr su 8
command.  In this case, the user name field is the user to
.Nm su
to, and the command name is ignored.  There should be a link from either
.Nm su<user>
or
.Nm su-<user>
to perform an ``su user'' or ``su - user'' as required.
.Pp
The command name may either be a fully qualified path name, or the
command will be run from the user's path.  If the command name is
left blank, then the user is allowed to run
.Em any
command.  If there is a blank command line in the database file, it should
be placed last.
.Pp
.Nm Priv
logs all activity via
.Xr syslog 3
using the
.Em LOG_AUTH
facility.  All failures contain the string
.Em \fR``\fPnot ok\fR''\fP .

.Sh HISTORY
A command called
.Nm
was written by Ron Kuris in December 1988, and later modified by
Dan Busarow, DPC Systems, in November 1991.
This version of
.Nm
bears little resemblence to the original command, but keeps the same
name because I like it.
