.SH NAME
priv \- execute commands as a different user
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B priv
.I command
.RI [ arguments\c
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I priv
allows authorised users to execute commands that run as different
users.
.PP
When
.I priv
is invoked, it reads a list of authorised commands from a database
file called
.B /usr/local/etc/priv/\fRusername\fP.
Each line of the database file is a colon-seperated list of fields.
The first two fields must be specified.
Blank lines or lines beginning with a ``#'' character are ignored.
The fields, in order, are:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP
expiry date
.IP
user name to run command as
.IP
flags
.IP
command name
.PD
.PP
The format of the expiry date is YYYYMMDDhhmm.
.PP
The flags field is an integer that contains the following bits:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP
F_SETUID     0000001  allow set-[gu]id programs to run
.IP
F_SYMLINK    0000002  allow symlink as command run
.IP
F_BASENAME   0000004  only check basename of command
.IP
F_LOGLS      0000010  do an 'ls' of the command run
.IP
F_LOGCWD     0000020  log working directory
.IP
F_LOGCMD     0000040  log full command name
.IP
F_LOGTTY     0000100  log user's terminal
.IP
F_BINPATH    0000200  allow any command in given path
.IP
F_GIVEREASON 0000400  ask for reason for running priv
.IP
F_CLEANENV   0001000  reset environment first 
.IP
F_SU         0100000  check su to an account
.PD
.PP
The
.I F_SU
flag enables
.I priv
to authorise an
.IR "su" (8)
command.
In this case, the user name field is the user to
.I su
to, and the command name is ignored.
There should be a link from either
.I su<user>
or
.I su-<user>
to perform an ``su user'' or ``su - user'' as required.
If ``-c command'' is given as arguments to this, then it
is appended to the
.I su
command line.
.PP
The command name may either be a fully qualified path name, or the
command will be run from the user's path.
If the command name is left blank, then the user is allowed to run
.I any
command.
If there is a blank command line in the database file, it should
be placed last.
.PP
If the
.I F_BINPATH
flag is given, then the command name in the configuration file will
be taken as a directory from which any command is valid. If
.I F_BASENAME
is also given, the fully qualified path name won't be necessary.
.PP
The following security precautions are taken before
.IR "execve" (3)ing
.IR "command" :
.TP
1.
All file descriptors except 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout) and 2 (stderr)
are closed.
.TP
2.
All signal handling is reset to the default handlers (refer to
.IR "signal" (3)).
.TP
3.
If
.I F_CLEANENV
is specified, all environment variables are discarded, and the
following are defined:
.IP
.B "COLUMNS"
and
.BR "LINES" :
set to the original values of 
.B COLUMNS
and
.B LINES
(respectively) if they only contain numbers.
Otherwise discarded.
.IP
.BR "HOME" :
set to the home directory of the target user.
.IP
.BR "IFS" :
set to space, tab and newline.
.IP
.B "LOGNAME"
and
.BR "USER" :
set to the username of the target user.
.IP
.BR "ORIG_HOME" ,
.BR "ORIG_LOGNAME"
and
.BR "ORIG_USER" :
set to the original values of
.BR "HOME" ,
.BR "LOGNAME"
and
.BR "USER"
respectively.
.IP
.BR "PATH" :
set to
.IR "/bin:/usr/bin" .
.IP
.BR "PRIVCMD" :
set to the command that was executed.
.IP
.BR "SHELL" :
set to
.IR "/bin/sh" .
.IP
.BR "TERM" :
set to the original value of
.B TERM
if it only contains characters
in the set [0-9a-zA-Z-+_.].
Otherwise set to
.IR "dumb" .
.PP
.I priv
logs all activity via
.IR "syslog" (3)
using the
.I LOG_AUTH
facility.
All failures contain the string
.I \fR``\fPnot ok\fR''\fP .
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 20
/usr/local/etc/priv
The database directory.
.PD
.SH SEE ALSO
.IR "execve" (3),
.IR "signal" (3),
.IR "su" (1)
.SH BUGS
When
.I priv
searchs the
.B PATH
environment variable for a command to run, the checks
are made as the effective user that
.I priv
runs as (root).
Be aware of this when setting permissions on a program.
.SH AUTHORS
Simon Burge <simonb@telstra.com.au> wrote this version
of
.I priv
with various enhancements provided by  
Luke Mewburn <lukem@connect.com.au>.
.SH HISTORY
A command called
.I priv
was written by Ron Kuris in December 1988, and later modified by
Dan Busarow, DPC Systems, in November 1991.
.PP
This version of
.I priv
bears little resemblence to the original command, but keeps the same
name because Simon likes it.
.PP
Some features (such as
.IR "F_CLEANENV" )
were inspired by similar functionality in
.IR super ,
which was written by Will Deich <will@astro.caltech.edu>.
